# Query Data

## Use Cluster

You can specify the cluster used for the current query in the drop-down box in the upper right corner. **You must choose a cluster before you initiate a query.**

Only clusters in the active state can be used.

## Query Result

The query result will be returned and displayed below the editor, where you can also find the Error status and other information produced by the query.

> **Note** Now, if multiple queries are executed simultaneously, the first query's result will be returned, and we will add the function of viewing other returns in later versions.
