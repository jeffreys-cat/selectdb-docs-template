After recharging units or paying through the other deduction channels, you can view the order information on the historical order page.

The order information includes information such as deduction channels, fees, and time.

You can issue invoices for orders generated by corporate transfer. You can print invoices through the corresponding channels for orders generated through the other deduction channels.

## Organization Internal Usage

After creating a warehouse, SelectDB Cloud collects warehouse-level usage data every minute, deducts fees by the hour, and then displays warehouse usage statistics to help you analyze the cost of different warehouses.

If the remaining units or the balance of the other deduction channels is insufficient, SelectDB Cloud will stop the service, but the data will be retained for 7 days.

To keep the online service running continuously, please ensure that the remaining units or the balance are sufficient.

## Warehouse Internal Usage
