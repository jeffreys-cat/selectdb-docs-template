# External Table

Currently, the warehouses generated by SelectDB Cloud are all running in the SelectDB VPC. If you need to access the external data source located in the customer's VPC, you need to contact the technical support of SelectDB to configure the Peering Connection or Privatelink between the VPCs so that the two VPCs can communicate with each other.
